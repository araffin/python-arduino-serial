Welcome to Robust Arduino Serial Protocol's documentation!
==========================================================

**Robust Arduino Serial** is a simple and robust serial communication
protocol. It was designed to make two arduinos communicate, but can also
be useful when you want a computer (e.g. a Raspberry Pi) to communicate
with an Arduino.

It supports both Python 3.8+.

This repository is part of the Robust Arduino Serial project, main
repository: `https://github.com/araffin/arduino-robust-serial`_

.. warning::

  Please read the `Medium Article`_ to have an overview of this
  protocol.

Implementations are available in various programming languages:

-  `Arduino`_
-  `Python`_
-  `C++`_
-  `Rust`_
